# Angular Project
## Please note this is currently still a work in progress.
A brief project pursued with the express purpose of improving my understanding of the Angular.js framework.

Initially the project was constructed in line with [this tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt1) from Angular.io.

Once completed, I then expanded on it to add my own features. 

## Commands
The project can be run by going into the folder and using the command:

```
ng serve
```

## Top Trumps
The first additional feature I added was top trumps, based off the popular card game. This is currently still a work in progress.
