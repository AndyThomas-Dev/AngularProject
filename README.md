# Angular Project
A brief project pursued with the express purpose of improving my understanding of the Angular.js framework.

Much of the project has been constructed in line with [this tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt1) from Angular.io.

## Commands
The project can be run by going into the folder and using the command:

```
ng serve
```
